## What is Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)

Imaging techniques in medicine play an important role as tools for diagnostic and
assistive purposes in the treatment process of patients. Examples of such techniques
are X-Rays, Ultra-sound (U/S), Computed Tomography (CT), Positron Emission
Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Some important
features of an imaging technique are the image resolution, the depth of penetration
and the image acquisition time. Generally, each method is used in specific cases as the
machines are designed to operate under specified image definition-image depth
parameters, due to the physical limitations of the respective machine and technology.

The visual imaging of the internal microstructures and biological systems in OCT is
achieved by measuring the backscattered electromagnetic radiation. OCT is a non-
invasive imaging technique capable of producing high resolution, cross-sectional
images. It is often compared to ultrasound (U/S) as both techniques detect waves,
with the difference that in OCT they are electromagnetic instead of sonic. The
advantage of OCT over other imaging techniques is its ability to acquire 3D images in
real time, using electromagnetic radiation in the optical and infrared part of the
spectrum. Consequently, it gives us the possibility of spatial resolution at the cellular
level, with the use of non-ionizing radiation, in real time and with an imaging depth of
up to several millimetres.

The method debuted in the 80s but was developed years later, after the technological
development of telecommunications (optical fibres, cheap sources) and low coherence
interference. In 1990, the technique had its greatest rise, where the first application in
ophthalmology occurred. Today the use of OCT has been extended to most medical
specialties and human organs, gaining ground in relation to other imaging techniques
and making it a really important tool in medicine.
