## Introduction

So far we have covered the basic principles and the different types of the OCT method. In general, OCT has research applications in many fields, but in this chapter, reference will be made to the various medical applications of the method. In recent years the OCT technique is attractive because it is fast, high-resolution, cheap and non-invasive, and it can also be used to create 3D images. It gives morphological as well as quantitative data. OCT has established itself as an important tool in medicine as well as research. There is still room to improve the technique and to test it in other areas of medicine. Only certain applications are mentioned epigrammatically in the following paragraphs. In many areas where it is not yet established its use is considered an emerging method. In fact, using fibre optic OCT, endoscopic images can be reproduced, achieving measurements of the human gastrointestinal, urinary and reproductive systems with a penetration depth of 1.2 to 1.6 mm. Applications in some medical fields are shown below.

## OCT in Cardiovascular Diseases

Geometric measurements are not only important in ophthalmology as OCT has also been used to assess cartilage degeneration due to osteoarthritis. It also finds other applications in endovascular imaging as it can distinguish possible coronary disease from an early stage. One of the main causes of death worldwide are cardiovascular diseases in which OCT has important applications, especially in acute coronary syndrome, strokes, atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension. Although in these tissues OCT has a small penetration depth of 1-3 mm the high image resolution of the method makes it useful. In the wall of a vessel, the inner and outer parts show a lot of backscatter so they are good sources of signal while the middle part is a low signal source as it does not scatter much. Atherosclerosis is a damage or loss of the vessel wall. The fibrous lesion exhibits high backscatter and is homogenous in the OCT image. So we distribute and separate lesions and atheromas according to where they have occurred as the radiation interaction behaviour changes. With OCT, thickness measurements of the fibrous cap are made to determine the vulnerability of the atheroma. Another application is in the identification of blood clots and indeed in their separation between white and red blood clots. A red blood clot absorbs infrared radiation and backscatters strongly due to high attenuation of the radiation. On the OCT image it appears as a bright mass while the white has low attenuation and is transparent. Cases such as transection, prolapse and incomplete vessel stratification as well as information about the neoendothelium and characteristics in general about the tissues covering the vascular endocoronary prosthesis are also obtained from the method.

that the endocoronary prosthesis is covered by a thin new intimal layer._

## OCT in Cancer

The detection and imaging of a tumor plays an important role in both the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. OCT in particular showing physiological and molecular changes is very useful for cancer. One application is based on the fact that cancerous tumors absorb and scatter the near-infrared more than healthy tissues. Of course, light scattering is not a sufficient element to characterize the tumor as benign or malignant, so a biopsy is inevitable, but it shows the diagnostic potential of the method. Besides that the depth cancer imaging is directly related to the prognosis of the patient's viability.

In malignant melanoma which is skin cancer the structures of the lower epidermis are affected and the basement membrane zone is not visible. In basal cell carcinoma there is disruption of stratification as hypo-reflective rounded areas are surrounded by a hyper-reflective halo. Disorganization of the epithelial stratification, thickening of the epithelium and keratin, heterogeneity in cell distribution, and disorganization of the basement membrane are observed in oral cancer. These morphologic features in premalignant oral tissue make OCT attractive. In lung cancer, adenocarcinomas are characterized by spherical or angular structures with poor or no signal, which are small and dark. Squamous cell carcinoma can be recognized by the presence of bright signals significantly brighter than the surrounding tissue, which are round or irregular in shape of variable sizes.

In breast cancer, in addition to the macroscopic features, such as the absence of normal structures and the presence of asteroid schematic lesions, the presence of fat cells of irregular size, very scattered fibrous trabeculae and the presence of dark areas surrounded by fibrous structures can also be distinguished. Cancerous lymph nodes are characterized by loss of normal tissue structure, large heterogeneity with hole-like structures, and areas of high backscatter probably due to changes in the size and structure of cell nuclei. In the esophagus, adenocarcinomas are characterized by neoplastic epithelium, which contains large amounts of mucus surrounded by a fibrotic and hyper-vascular layer of the tumor. Finally, we will mention cancer in the urinary system. The epithelium in the prostate is homogeneous as well as the presence of irregular gland outlines, the infiltration of glands of variable sizes between benign ones and the presence of ethmoid patterns. Kidney tumors have enlarged, scattered tumor "nests" separated by layer that scatters the radiation a little. In fact, the distinction of carcinoma of the renal cell and renal oncocytoma, benign renal tumor, is possible from the morphological characteristics and after quantitative analysis of the radiation attenuation coefficient since the coefficient of normal renal parenchyma differs significantly from malignant tumors.

The clinical applications of OCT do not stop here. OCT has applications even in dentistry by imaging tissues and structural elements revealing fractures and micro cracks. A valid prognosis of caries is also foreseen as intense birefringence is observed in the enamel and anisotropic propagation of light through dental tubules, particularly important here is the PS-OCT technique.
