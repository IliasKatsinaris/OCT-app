title: Development of the educational application
---

The development of the educational application was carried out using **Next.js**.
Leveraging the **AriaDocs template** for Next JS, which provides a clean and accessible documentation layout, the application offers an intuitive interface for learning information about Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).
Emphasis was placed also on creating a user-friendly and responsive design, ensuring compatibility across various devices. The structure of the app was designed to present theoretical content with interactive images and self-assessment quizzes seamlessly to enhance user engagement and self-evaluation.

## Quiz Functionality

The educational application features an interactive quiz designed to enhance user engagement and self-assessment. The quiz dynamically selects 30 questions from a pool of 100 questions to ensure variety in each attempt.
The questions cover key concepts
related to Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), including anatomy, pathology, and clinical applications. Users progress through the quiz by selecting their answers, and upon completion, a detailed results page is displayed.
The results page provides immediate feedback, presenting the number of correct and incorrect answers alongside the correct answers for review.
This approach helps users identify knowledge gaps and reinforces learning by allowing them to revisit incorrect responses and
understand the correct information. The quiz component was built with randomized question selection
to prevent memorization and ensure a comprehensive evaluation experience.
