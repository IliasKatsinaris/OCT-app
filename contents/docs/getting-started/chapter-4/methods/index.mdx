A variety of modern web development tools and frameworks were utilized to build the educational application. **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)** served as the core framework for its efficient page-based routing, performance optimizations. **[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)** was implemented to allow the integration of Markdown with JSX, enabling dynamic content rendering with embedded media and interactive elements. The **[AriaDocs template](https://ariakit.org/examples/docs)** provided pre-built components and styling for structured documentation pages, significantly speeding up development while adhering to accessibility best practices. Additionally, the application uses **[CSS Modules](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support)** to manage consistent styling and design responsiveness.
