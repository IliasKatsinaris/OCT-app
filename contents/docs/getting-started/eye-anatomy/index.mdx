It is necessary for ophthalmologists to diagnose various eye diseases as early as
possible. Over the years many diagnostic techniques and treatments have been
developed. One of the most modern diagnostic technologies is OCT, which has many
advantages (eg. safe, non-invasive) and only a few disadvantages. For the reasons
above it is a very useful tool for the modern ophthalmologist.

In this work, we will present the eye anatomy and physiology as well as the OCT
technology, the physical principles of its operation and also in which cases and
diseases it can provide valuable information to the ophthalmologists.

Subsequently, an educational application will be developed which will educate the
ophthalmology resident in the OCT field, as well as give the ability to the user to self-
assess through multiple choice questions.
