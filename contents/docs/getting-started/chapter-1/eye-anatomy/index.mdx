## Introduction

The retina of the eye is an anatomical layer containing mainly photoreceptor and glial cells within the eye and its main purpose is to capture the incoming photons and to transmit them along neural pathways as electrical and chemical signals for the brain to create a visual picture. The retina is located in the posterior segment of the eye and it creates the innermost boundary with other cell layers which contain the vascular choroid and the fibrous sclera. Various medical conditions happen in the retina at different ages, many of which severely affect the visual ability of a person and subsequently downgrade the quality of life.

## Structure and Function

The structure and function of the retina is shown below:

- **Photoreceptor cells**
- **Layers of the retina**
- **Macula**

### Photoreceptor Cells

Photoreceptor cells are special cells in the retina that are responsible for converting light into signals that are sent to the brain. Photoreceptors give us our color vision and night vision. There are two types of photoreceptor cells: rods and cones which are uniquely located towards the posterior aspect of the retinal sublayers, further away from the pupil where light enters the eye. Rods are more sensitive in dim light (scotopic vision) and reside in the periphery of the retina. Cones are more sensitive in daylight (photopic vision) and capture wavelengths of colored light.

### Layers of the Retina

The retina subdivides into ten distinct layers that are described in order from the innermost layers closer to the pupil to the layers further towards the posterior of the eyeball:

- **Inner Limiting Membrane**:  
  Innermost layer of the retina.

- **Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer**:  
  A layer composed of retinal ganglion cell axons combined with astrocytes and processes of Muller cells.

- **Ganglion Cell Layer**:  
  The layer of ganglion cell bodies that project their axons to form the optic nerve.

- **Inner Plexiform Layer**:  
  The layer where the axons of bipolar cells synapse to the ganglion cells.

- **Inner Nuclear Layer**:  
  The layer composed of the cell bodies of bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells.

- **Outer Plexiform Layer**:  
  The region where projections from photoreceptor cells synapse with the dendrites of the cells residing in the inner nuclear layer

- **Outer Nuclear Layer**:  
  The layer containing the cell bodies of both rods and cones.

- **External Limiting Membrane**:  
  A region composed of gap-junctions between photoreceptor cells and Muller cells.

- **Photoreceptor Layer**:  
  The region comprising the inner and outer segments of rods and cones.

- **Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)**:  
  The outermost retinal layer that spans a width of a single cell located between the neural retina and the Bruch membrane, adjacent to the highly-vascularized choroid layer.

### Macula

The macula is the most sensitive area of the retina, offering the highest visual sharpness. It has a yellowish pigmented appearance and upon fundoscopic examination it is found temporally from the optic disc. The yellow coloring is produced by lutein and zeaxanthin, the carotenoids that make up the macular pigments. These macular pigments are known to possess anti-inflammatory and blue-light filtering properties. The fovea is an avascular depression in the center of the macula, and it contains a high concentration of cones.

The macula subdivides into the following concentric zones that show decreasing rod density and fewer layers of cells covering the photoreceptor cells:

- **Perifovea**
- **Parafovea**
- **Fovea**
- **Foveal Avascular Zone**
- **Foveola**
- **Umbo**

## Embryology

The retina arises from the diencephalon of the embryo as the optic vesicle during the first month. It later forms an invagination called the optic sulcus. This process of invagination results in the formation of the pigmented layer and the neural layers of the retina. During this time, mesenchymal tissue will surround the optic vesicle, which will develop into the uvea. The neural retina originates from the inner layer, and the pigmented retina originates from the peripheral layer. Axons from the ganglion cells travel through the optic stalk that bridges the optic cup to the embryo and eventually form the optic nerve. Ventrally, another invagination called the optic fissure engulfs a temporary blood vessel called the hyaloid artery which later develops into the central retinal artery.

## Blood Supply and Lymphatics

Blood vessels and the choroid vascularizes the retina. The choroid supplies the outer layers of the retina while branches of significant blood vessels supply the inner retinal layers.

Central Retinal Artery – this is the major vessel that supplies the inner layers of the retina. It travels inside of the optic nerve sheath and it penetrates the eye at the optic disc. This artery divides into superior and inferior arcades that will form the blood-retina barrier. It originates as a branch of the ophthalmic artery.

Central Retinal Vein – the main drainage pathway of the retina. It travels with the central retinal artery in the sheath of the optic nerve.

The Long Posterior Ciliary Arteries – two vessels that branch from the ophthalmic artery and pierce the sclera on the back of the eye near the entry zone of the optic nerve. These arteries supply the choroid in the medial and lateral horizontal planes and the anterior structures of the eye.

Short Posterior Ciliary Arteries – they arise as a few branches from the ophthalmic artery and branch into 10-20 smaller vessels that penetrate the posterior sclera in a ring around the optic nerve.  These branched vessels anastomose to form the circle of Zinn that supplies the area of the optic cup at the level of the choroid.

Choroid – the second major layer of the eye that vascularizes the outer retina. The Bruch membrane lies between the retinal pigment epithelial layer and the capillary lamina of the choroid, creating the basement membrane of the choroid. The choriocapillaris is thickest behind the fovea (10 μm) and thins out towards the periphery (7 μm).

The retina does not include lymphatic vessels.

## Nerves

The optic nerve is the primary sensory tract for optical data accumulated by the photoreceptor cells of the retina to move to the brain. The axons of the ganglion cells that shape the optic nerve meet and exit from the sphere at the optic disc where there are nor rods or cones, causing a deficit within the visual field named as the blind spot.

## Physiologic Variant

Myopia is a refractive condition where the focal convergence of light that goes through the cornea and the lens falls short of the fovea, causing nearsightedness. A common cause of myopia is the axial elongation of the globe, which causes the straining of the retina. An error of refraction between -6.0 to -8.0 diopters, or high myopia, is a risk factor for retinal detachment.

Ocular albinism is an X-linked disorder. In this condition there is hypopigmentation of the fundus which often presents with congenital nystagmus, iris translucency, reduced visual sharpness and strabismus.

## Surgical Considerations

Laser demarcation is often used to surgically repair round hole retinal detachment. This method promotes the adhesion between the neural retinal layers and the retinal pigment epithelium. Laser photocoagulation is mainly used for small detachments because this procedure only acts as a barrier, limiting the progression of the subretinal fluid.

## Clinical Significance

The following are pathologies relating to the retina:

- **Retinal Detachment**
- **Retinal Artery Occlusion**
- **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
- **Glaucoma**
- **Diabetic Retinopathy**
- **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**
- **Retinopathy of Prematurity**
- **Retinitis Pigmentosa**
- **Retinoblastoma**
- **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**
- **Color Vision Deficiency**

Retinal Detachment is the separation of the retinal layers happening between the retinal pigment epithelium and the inner layers of the retina causing ischemia and photoreceptor degeneration. Retinal detachment is typically an ocular emergency, but an early detection and treatment can prevent the permanent vision loss.  Major risk factors for retinal detachment are myopia, trauma, cataract surgery, diabetic retinopathy, and old age. Retinal detachments are classified as rhegmatogenous, tractional, or exudative. Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment is the most prevalent and in this condition a tear in the retina permits liquified vitreous to seep beneath the retinal layers. Posterior vitreous detachment is a typical cause of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment where the vitreous's collagenous fibers fail to separate from the retina’s inner limiting membrane of during the vitreous’ natural condensation, causing a retinal tear as it pulls away. Retinal scarring, which is frequently seen in diabetic retinopathy, causes tractional retinal detachment, which occurs less frequently. Exudative retinal detachment, which typically arises from conditions such intraocular tumors or age-related macular degeneration, is the physical disruption of the subretinal space due to fluid collection and blood-retinal barrier collapse without retinal tears or holes.

Retinal Artery Occlusion is the obstruction of the central retinal artery or the branch retinal arteries causing retinal ischemia and serious vision loss. An ocular emergency known as central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is often brought on by atherosclerosis or an embolism that starts in the carotid arteries. An infarction leads to ischemia in the inner retinal layers resulting in the loss of vision and occasionally retinal hemorrhages. The formation of a cherry-red spot on the macula with a pale clearing surrounding its perimeter due to ischemia is the typical indication of CRAO seen during fundoscopic examination. About 38% of all acute retinal occlusions are branch retinal artery occlusions (BRAO), which generally happen anatomically at the branching points between the central retinal artery's smaller capillaries. BRAO has better visual prognosis than CRAO.
Age-Related Macular Degeneration is a neurodegenerative disease that impairs the connection between the neural retinal layers and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and causes severe central vision loss. The two types of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are the neovascular type, called "wet" macular degeneration, and the non-neovascular atrophic type, called "dry" macular degeneration. Dry AMD exposes characteristic lesions of the RPE as a result of the accumulation of cellular waste called lipofuscin, which causes the formation of the pathognomonic yellowish, amorphic deposits called drusen between the RPE and the Bruch membrane. Abnormal neovascularization that penetrates the Bruch membrane and extends from the choroid causes wet AMD. Macular edema may arise from spontaneous bleeding and subsequent plasma leakage from these fragile vessels. The non-neovascular atrophic type (dry) is the most prevalent of the two, and occurs in 90% of all cases while the other 10% is in the form of neovascular AMD. Increased age is a main risk factor for AMD which is the primary cause of blindness in both men and women, aged 55 years and older.

Glaucoma is the progressive degeneration of ganglion cells and their axons causing the loss of peripheral and, ultimately, central vision. As the neuroretinal rim of the optic disc thins due to degeneration, this loss of ganglion cells causes optic cupping, in which the optic nerve cup enlarges relative to the optic disc. Optic cupping may also be present in patients without glaucoma, but an enlarged size ratio of the optic cup to the optic disc combined with specific margins of the optic cup can be indicative of glaucoma. The iridocorneal angle is described by the closed-angle or open-angle classifications of glaucoma. In closed-angle glaucoma, the iridocorneal angle narrows, so that the iris is pressed against the cornea. This prevents the flow of aqueous humor from being collected by the trabecular meshwork and this leads to an increase in intraocular pressure, which subsequently causes the optic neuropathy. The etiology of open-angle glaucoma, in which the iridocorneal angle does not impede the flow of aqueous humor, is unclear and may or may not manifest as elevated intraocular pressure.

Diabetic Retinopathy is a retinal microvascular disease that results from elevated blood sugar from both type I and type II diabetes. It is the most frequent complication within diabetic eye disease, the leading cause of blindness in adults before the age of 75 in developed countries. Diabetic retinopathy can be classified into two stages· the non-proliferative stage, which frequently presents early among patients with diabetes, and the more advanced proliferative stage. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy is portrayed by the degeneration of the retinal microvasculature which frequently leads in microaneurysms and the leakage of plasma through the weakened blood-retinal barrier. This leakage of fluid can accumulate and result in macular edema, which leads to the loss of visual acuity. Neovascularization is a response to ischemia and arterial blockage in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These fragile vessels are prone to rupturing which leads to vitreous hemorrhage where blood in the vitreous can block light from reaching the fovea and also create scarring which may lead to tractional retinal detachment.

Cytomegalovirus Retinitis is an opportunistic viral infection of the retina caused by CMV, which is a member of the herpes virus family. Progressive retinal necrosis and scarring, which can result in retinal detachment, macular edema, and vision loss, are hallmarks of CMV retinitis. Populations that are deemed to be at high risk for CMV retinitis are characterized by the following: having HIV, being immunosuppressed, or have had an organ transplantation. CMV retinitis is the most common intraocular complication in HIV patients and is the leading cause of blindness in patients with AIDS. Antiviral drugs that can be taken orally, intravenously, or via ocular injection are frequently used as treatment.

Retinopathy of Prematurity is the abnormal development of blood vessels and subsequent inadequate vascularization of the retina in the developing neonate due to premature birth. Hypoxia causes the abnormal development of the retinal blood vessels, which in severe cases can cause a retinal detachment that, if ignored, could cause blindness. Retinopathy of prematurity is characterized by five stages that describe the severity of the disease and distinctive pathological formations.

Retinitis Pigmentosa is a class of inherited rod-cone dystrophies defined by the progressive loss of rods from the periphery accompanied by the loss of cones, centrally located in the retina. This progressive degeneration often leads to tunnel vision and, in some cases, complete vision loss. Hereditary retinal dystrophy, another name for retinal pigmentosa, is the most prevalent inherited retinal condition. There are three possible inheritance patterns: X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive.

Retinoblastoma is a malignant tumor of the developing retina of children due to a loss of function mutation in the Rb1 tumor suppressor gene. About 3% of all pediatric malignancies are retinablastomas, the most prevalent ophthalmic tumor in children. Leukocoria and strabismus are two of its main clinical characteristics.
Central Serous Chorioretinopathy is a macular condition where the retinal pigment epithelium is damaged, resulting in fluid leakage from the capillary lamina of the choroid to the subretinal area. Central vision loss results from the resulting macular edema; in 30 to 40% of cases, the disease has recurred, but the majority of cases resolve on their own. Exogenous glucocorticoid use is linked to central serous chorioretinopathy, which is more common in middle-aged men.

Color Vision Deficiency is an distorted color perception and decreased color contrast sensitivity as a result of photopigment defects inside the cone cells of the retina. Red-green color blindness, the most prevalent type, is caused by a deficiency or anomaly in either the green (deutrans) or red (protans) cone cells. Compared to red-green color blindness, blue-yellow color blindness is less common. The most severe type of color blindness, known as total color vision loss, is caused by rod and cone monochromatism. Rod monochromatism, also known as achromatopsia, is a total lack of cone cell function leading to complete grayscale vision solely from rod cells. Cone monochromatism is defined as a deficit in two out of the three types of cone cells, preventing the ability to compare color vision stimuli, which is a prerequisite for the brain to perceive color. People who suffer cone monochromatism or achromatopsia frequently exhibit nystagmus and poor visual acuity.
