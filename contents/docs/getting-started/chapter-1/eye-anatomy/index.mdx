## Introduction

The retina is a sheet of photoreceptor and glial cells in the eye that absorbs incoming
light particles and conveys them through neural pathways as electrical and chemical
signals, enabling the brain to interpret a visual image. Situated in the back section of
the eye, the retina constitutes the innermost layer, bordered by other key structures
such as the vascular choroid and the fibrous sclera. Various diseases can affect the
retina at different points in life, often significantly impairing vision and, as a result,
diminishing quality of life.

**Structure and Function**

The following subjects concerning the anatomy and functionality of the retina are
presented below:

- **Photoreceptor cells**
- **Layers of the retina**
- **Macula**

### Photoreceptor Cells

Photoreceptor cells, consisting of rods and cones, are distinctively positioned toward
the posterior part of the retinal layers, farther from the pupil where light enters the
eye. Rods are highly sensitive to low light (scotopic vision) and are predominantly
located in the peripheral retina. Cones, which are more responsive to bright light
(photopic vision), detect colored wavelengths and are concentrated in the central
retina at the fovea. The retina contains approximately 6 million cones and over 100
million rods.

There are three types of cones: tritans, deutans, and protans, which are specialized to
detect short, medium, and long wavelengths, corresponding to blue, green, and red
light, respectively. The overlapping sensitivity of these cone types to different
wavelengths enables humans to perceive the full visible spectrum.

Rod cells, on the other hand, contain rhodopsin, a light-sensitive pigment composed
of retinal, which facilitates photon absorption. Retinal is derived from vitamin A
aldehyde, making vitamin A a critical nutrient for the phototransduction process. A
deficiency in vitamin A is a leading cause of blindness in young children, particularly
in underdeveloped regions such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

### Layers of the Retina

The retina is further divided into ten distinct layers, listed sequentially from the
innermost layers nearest to the pupil to those situated closer to the posterior and
peripheral regions of the eyeball:

- **Inner Limiting Membrane**:  
  This is the innermost layer of the retina, creating a smooth interface with the vitreous humor, which fills the vitreous chamber. The periphery of this layer comprises Müller glial cells, which are vital for maintaining retinal structure and supporting other cellular functions.

- **Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer**:  
  This layer consists of retinal ganglion cell axons, interspersed with astrocytes and Müller cell processes. The inner limiting membrane serves as the basal layer for the nerve fiber cells.

- **Ganglion Cell Layer**:  
  Made up of the cell bodies of ganglion cells, this layer sends axons outward to eventually form the optic nerve.

- **Inner Plexiform Layer**:  
   This is where the axons of bipolar cells connect with ganglion cells. Amacrine cell dendrites also interact here, modulating electrical signals and preventing lateral signal enhancement.

- **Inner Nuclear Layer**:  
   This layer contains the cell bodies of bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells. Bipolar cells act as conduits, transmitting synaptic signals from photoreceptors to ganglion cells, while horizontal cells regulate feedback to rods and cones.

- **Outer Plexiform Layer**:  
   The zone where photoreceptor cell projections synapse with the dendrites of cells located in the inner nuclear layer.

- **Outer Nuclear Layer**:  
   This layer houses the cell bodies of rods and cones.

- **External Limiting Membrane**:  
   A structure formed by gap junctions between photoreceptor cells and Müller cells, it separates the cell bodies of rods and cones from their inner and outer segments.

- **Photoreceptor Layer**:  
   Composed of the inner and outer segments of rods and cones. The outer segments contain membrane-bound discs with light-sensitive pigments, like rhodopsin, crucial for phototransduction, while the inner segments house mitochondria to support the photoreceptors' high energy demands.

- **Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)**:  
   The outermost retinal layer, one cell thick, lies between the neural retina and the Bruch membrane, adjacent to the vascular choroid. The RPE forms part of the blood-retinal barrier and plays key roles, including ion and water transport, secretion of growth factors, and recycling of retinal molecules for phototransduction. Its cells intermix with the outer segments of rods and cones, ensuring their maintenance and supporting the underlying capillary endothelium.

### Macula

The macula, also referred to as the macula lutea due to its yellowish pigment, represents the most sensitive region of the retina, providing the highest level of visual sharpness. It is situated temporally relative to the optic disc, as observed during a fundoscopic exam. The macular pigments, lutein and zeaxanthin, are carotenoids responsible for the yellow hue. These pigments possess anti-inflammatory properties and filter blue light.

Dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin has been demonstrated to enhance pigment density and is linked to a lower risk of diabetic retinopathy in adults and retinopathy of prematurity in pre-term infants. At the center of the macula lies the **fovea**, a depression devoid of blood vessels that is densely packed with cones.

The macula is further divided into progressively smaller concentric zones, each exhibiting a reduction in rod density and fewer cell layers overlying the photoreceptor cells:

- **Perifovea**
- **Parafovea**
- **Fovea**
- **Foveal Avascular Zone**
- **Foveola**
- **Umbo**

## Embryology

The retina develops from the diencephalon of the embryo, beginning as the optic
vesicle during the first month of gestation and forming an invagination known as the
optic sulcus. This invagination leads to the creation of the retina's neural and
pigmented layers. Surrounding the optic vesicle during this stage, mesenchymal tissue
later differentiates into the uvea.

The neural retina originates from the inner layer of the optic vesicle, while the
pigmented retina arises from the outer layer. Axons from ganglion cells extend
through the optic stalk, which connects the optic cup to the embryo, and these axons
eventually form the optic nerve. On the ventral side, a secondary invagination, the
optic fissure, encloses a temporary blood vessel called the hyaloid artery, which later
develops into the central retinal artery.

## Blood Supply and Lymphatics

The retina is vascularized by both blood vessels and the choroid. The choroid provides nutrients and oxygen to the outer retinal layers, while branches of major blood vessels supply the inner layers. Below are descriptions of the specific vessels involved in retinal vascularization:

- **Central Retinal Artery**:  
  This is the primary vessel supplying the inner retinal layers. It travels within the optic nerve sheath and enters the eye at the optic disc. After entry, it divides into superior and inferior arcades, which contribute to forming the blood-retina barrier. The central retinal artery is a significant branch of the ophthalmic artery.

- **Central Retinal Vein**:  
  This vein serves as the main drainage pathway for the retina, running parallel to the central retinal artery within the optic nerve sheath.

- **Long Posterior Ciliary Arteries**:  
  These two arteries originate from the ophthalmic artery, penetrate the posterior sclera near the optic nerve, and extend along the medial and lateral horizontal planes. They supply the choroid and anterior eye structures.

- **Short Posterior Ciliary Arteries**:  
  Emerging as several branches from the ophthalmic artery, these arteries split into 10–20 smaller vessels that pierce the posterior sclera around the optic nerve. They anastomose to form the circle of Zinn, which supplies the optic cup region at the choroid level. Perpendicular terminal arterioles from these arteries nourish the Bruch membrane and the outer retina.

- **Choroid**:  
  The choroid forms the second major tunic of the eye, responsible for vascularizing the outer retinal layers. The **Bruch membrane**, located between the retinal pigment epithelium and the choriocapillaris, acts as the basement membrane of the choroid. The **choriocapillaris**, or capillary lamina, is thickest beneath the fovea (10 micrometers) and gradually thins toward the periphery (7 micrometers).

The retina does not contain lymphatic vessels.

## Nerves

The optic nerve serves as the main sensory pathway, transmitting visual information
gathered by the retina's photoreceptor cells to the brain. It is composed of axons from
the ganglion cells, which converge and exit the eye at the optic disc. This area lacks
rods and cones, creating a gap in the visual field known as the blind spot.

## Physiologic Variant

**Myopia** is a prevalent refractive disorder in which light passing through the cornea and lens converges before reaching the fovea, causing nearsightedness. One primary cause is axial elongation of the globe, which can strain the retina. **High myopia**, typically defined as a refractive error between -6.0 to -8.0 diopters, increases the risk of retinal detachment and is especially common in East Asia.

In severe cases, **pathological myopia** may develop, which differs from high myopia by involving not only axial elongation but also structural deformations of the posterior segment, such as posterior staphyloma. This condition is characterized by an abnormal reduction in the curvature radius of the posterior pole, encompassing the retina and sometimes the uvea, caused by scleral bulging and thinning due to elongation.

Pathologies specifically affecting the macula in the posterior pole are collectively termed **myopic maculopathies**, which are among the leading causes of low vision and legal blindness worldwide.

**Ocular** albinism is an X-linked disorder marked by hypopigmentation of the fundus and commonly presents with:

- Congenital nystagmus
- Iris translucency
- Significant visual acuity reduction
- Strabismus

Ocular albinism results from mutations in the gene encoding the **G protein-coupled receptor 143 (GPR143)**, thought to function as a melanosome transmembrane protein. This mutation impairs melanin transport to the retinal pigment epithelium and iris, leading to the disorder.

## Clinical Significance

The following are pathologies relating to the retina:

- **Retinal Detachment**
- **Retinal Artery Occlusion**
- **Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**
- **Glaucoma**
- **Diabetic Retinopathy**
- **Cytomegalovirus Retinitis**
- **Retinopathy of Prematurity**
- **Retinitis Pigmentosa**
- **Retinoblastoma**
- **Central Serous Chorioretinopathy**
- **Color Vision Deficiency**

**Retinal Detachment** occurs when there is a disconnection between the retinal
pigment epithelium and the inner neural layers of the retina, leading to ischemia and
subsequent degeneration of photoreceptors. Early detection and treatment are critical
in preventing permanent vision loss, as retinal detachment is typically considered an
ocular emergency. Major risk factors for retinal detachment include myopia, trauma,
cataract surgery, diabetic retinopathy, and aging. There are three main types of retinal
detachment: rhegmatogenous, tractional, and exudative. Rhegmatogenous retinal
detachment is the most common type and involves a tear in the retina that allows
liquefied vitreous fluid to seep beneath the retinal layers. A common cause of this type
is posterior vitreous detachment, where the collagen fibers of the vitreous body fail to
separate properly from the inner limiting membrane of the retina during its natural
condensation, resulting in a retinal tear. Tractional retinal detachment occurs less
frequently and is typically caused by retinal scarring, often seen in diabetic
retinopathy. In contrast, exudative retinal detachment involves the physical disruption
of the subretinal space due to fluid accumulation and the breakdown of the blood-
retinal barrier, without any retinal tears or holes. This type is associated with
conditions like intraocular tumors or age-related macular degeneration

**Retinal Artery Occlusion** refers to the blockage of either the central retinal artery or
its branch arteries, leading to retinal ischemia and significant vision loss. Central
retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a medical emergency, often caused by
atherosclerosis or embolism originating from the carotid arteries. This blockage
results in infarction and ischemia in the inner retinal layers, contributing to vision loss
and sometimes retinal hemorrhages. A common sign of CRAO during a fundoscopic
examination is a cherry-red spot on the macula, surrounded by a pale area due to
ischemia. Branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) typically occurs at branching
points of smaller vessels from the central retinal artery, accounting for about 38% of
acute retinal occlusions. BRAO generally has a better visual prognosis than CRAO.

**Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD)** is a neurodegenerative disease that
affects the junction between the neural retinal layers and the retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE), leading to severe central vision loss. AMD is categorized into two
types: the non-neovascular atrophic type, also known as "dry" macular degeneration,
and the neovascular type, known as "wet" macular degeneration. Dry AMD is
characterized by lesions of the RPE caused by the accumulation of cellular debris
called lipofuscin. This debris leads to the formation of yellowish, amorphous deposits
called drusen between the RPE and the Bruch membrane. Wet AMD occurs when
abnormal blood vessels from the choroid grow and penetrate the Bruch membrane,
potentially causing hemorrhage and leakage of plasma, which leads to macular
edema. Dry AMD is more common, accounting for 90% of cases, while wet AMD
represents about 10%. Increased age is a major risk factor for AMD, which is the
leading cause of blindness in individuals aged 55 and older, affecting both males and
females.

**Glaucoma** is a progressive condition characterized by the gradual degeneration of
ganglion cells and their axons, leading to the loss of peripheral vision and, eventually,
central vision. This degeneration results in optic cupping, where the optic nerve cup
enlarges in comparison to the optic disc, and the neuroretinal rim thins. Although
optic cupping can be present in individuals without glaucoma, an increased cup-to-
disc ratio and certain features of the optic cup margins can suggest the presence of
glaucoma. Glaucoma is classified into closed-angle and open-angle types, referring to
the iridocorneal angle. In closed-angle glaucoma, the angle closes, causing the iris to
press against the cornea and block the flow of aqueous humor, leading to increased
intraocular pressure and optic neuropathy. In open-angle glaucoma, the angle remains
open, but the cause is not well understood and may or may not involve elevated
intraocular pressure.

**Diabetic Retinopathy**is a retinal microvascular disorder caused by elevated blood
sugar levels, occurring in both type I and type II diabetes. It is the most common
complication of diabetic eye disease and is the leading cause of blindness in adults
under 75 years of age in developed countries. Diabetic retinopathy can be divided into
two stages: the non-proliferative stage, which typically appears early in diabetes, and
the more advanced proliferative stage. In the non-proliferative stage, degeneration of
the retinal microvasculature leads to the formation of microaneurysms and leakage of
plasma through the compromised blood-retinal barrier. This leakage can result in
macular edema, potentially impairing visual acuity. In the proliferative stage,
neovascularization occurs in response to artery occlusion and ischemia. These fragile
new vessels are prone to rupture, causing vitreous hemorrhage, where blood leaks into
the vitreous body, obstructing light from reaching the fovea. This can also lead to
scarring, which may result in tractional retinal detachment.

**Cytomegalovirus Retinitis** is an opportunistic viral infection of the retina caused by
cytomegalovirus (CMV), a member of the herpesvirus family. CMV retinitis leads to
progressive retinal necrosis and scarring, potentially causing retinal detachment,
macular edema, and vision loss. High-risk groups for CMV retinitis include
individuals with HIV/AIDS, those who are immunosuppressed, or organ transplant
recipients. It is the most common intraocular complication in HIV patients and a
leading cause of blindness in AIDS patients. Treatment typically involves antiviral
medications, which may be administered orally, intravenously, or via ocular injection

**Retinopathy of Prematurity** refers to the abnormal growth of blood vessels and
incomplete retinal vascularization in premature infants. This pathological vessel
growth is due to hypoxia, and in severe cases, it can lead to retinal detachment and
blindness if left untreated. Retinopathy of prematurity is classified into five stages
based on disease severity and the nature of pathological formations.

**Retinitis Pigmentosa** is a group of inherited rod-cone dystrophies marked by the
gradual loss of rods in the peripheral retina, followed by the loss of cones in the
central retina. This progressive degeneration typically results in tunnel vision and, in
advanced cases, complete vision loss. Retinitis pigmentosa, also known as hereditary
retinal dystrophy, is the most common inherited retinal disease. Its inheritance can be
autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive. Night blindness
(nyctalopia) is common in the early stages, while later stages show retinal atrophy
with bone-spicule-shaped pigment deposits upon fundus examination.

**Retinoblastoma** is a malignant tumor in the developing neural retina of young
children, caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the Rb1 tumor suppressor gene. It
is the most common childhood intraocular neoplasm, accounting for about 3% of
pediatric cancers. Key clinical features include leukocoria (white reflex) and
strabismus.

**Central Serous Chorioretinopathy** is a macular condition where the retinal pigment
epithelium is compromised, leading to fluid leakage from the choroidal capillaries
into the subretinal space. This causes macular edema, resulting in central vision loss.
While the disease can recur in 30-40% of cases, many cases are self-limiting. Central
serous chorioretinopathy is more common in middle-aged males and is often linked to
exogenous glucocorticoid use.

**Color Vision Deficiency** is a condition where individuals experience abnormal color
perception and reduced color contrast sensitivity due to defects in the photopigments
of the cone cells in the retina. The most common form of color vision deficiency is
red-green color blindness, which results from abnormalities or deficits in the red
(protans) or green (deutrans) cone cells. These disorders are inherited in an X-linked
recessive manner, meaning they are more common in males than females. The
specific dysfunctions are referred to as protanopia (red cone dysfunction) and
deuteranopia (green cone dysfunction). Milder forms of color blindness are called
protanomaly and deuteranomaly, where the red and green photopigments are
abnormal but still allow some color perception. Blue-yellow color blindness is rarer
than red-green color blindness and is caused by dysfunction in the blue cone cells.
The conditions are known as tritanopia (complete blue cone dysfunction) and
tritanomaly (abnormal blue photopigment). The inheritance patterns for tritanopia and
tritanomaly are autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive, respectively, and these
conditions affect both males and females equally. Total color vision deficiency is the
most severe form of color blindness and can result from either rod monochromatism
(achromatopsia) or cone monochromatism. In rod monochromatism, there is a
complete loss of cone cell function, leading to grayscale vision that relies entirely on
rod cells. Cone monochromatism occurs when there is a deficit in two out of the three
types of cone cells, impairing the ability to compare color stimuli, which is essential
for perceiving color. Individuals with achromatopsia or cone monochromatism often
experience poor visual acuity and may have nystagmus (involuntary eye movements).
