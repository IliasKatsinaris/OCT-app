## Introduction

The retina is a sheet of photoreceptor and glial cells in the eye that absorbs incoming
light particles and conveys them through neural pathways as electrical and chemical
signals, enabling the brain to interpret a visual image. Situated in the back section of
the eye, the retina constitutes the innermost layer, bordered by other key structures
such as the vascular choroid and the fibrous sclera. Various diseases can affect the
retina at different points in life, often significantly impairing vision and, as a result,
diminishing quality of life.

**Structure and Function**

The following subjects concerning the anatomy and functionality of the retina are
presented below:

- **Photoreceptor cells**
- **Layers of the retina**
- **Macula**

### Photoreceptor Cells

Photoreceptor cells, consisting of rods and cones, are distinctively positioned toward
the posterior part of the retinal layers, farther from the pupil where light enters the
eye. Rods are highly sensitive to low light (scotopic vision) and are predominantly
located in the peripheral retina. Cones, which are more responsive to bright light
(photopic vision), detect colored wavelengths and are concentrated in the central
retina at the fovea. The retina contains approximately 6 million cones and over 100
million rods.

There are three types of cones: tritans, deutans, and protans, which are specialized to
detect short, medium, and long wavelengths, corresponding to blue, green, and red
light, respectively. The overlapping sensitivity of these cone types to different
wavelengths enables humans to perceive the full visible spectrum.

Rod cells, on the other hand, contain rhodopsin, a light-sensitive pigment composed
of retinal, which facilitates photon absorption. Retinal is derived from vitamin A
aldehyde, making vitamin A a critical nutrient for the phototransduction process. A
deficiency in vitamin A is a leading cause of blindness in young children, particularly
in underdeveloped regions such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

### Layers of the Retina

The retina is further divided into ten distinct layers, listed sequentially from the
innermost layers nearest to the pupil to those situated closer to the posterior and
peripheral regions of the eyeball:

- **Inner Limiting Membrane**:  
  This is the innermost layer of the retina, creating a smooth interface with the vitreous humor, which fills the vitreous chamber. The periphery of this layer comprises Müller glial cells, which are vital for maintaining retinal structure and supporting other cellular functions.

- **Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer**:  
  This layer consists of retinal ganglion cell axons, interspersed with astrocytes and Müller cell processes. The inner limiting membrane serves as the basal layer for the nerve fiber cells.

- **Ganglion Cell Layer**:  
  Made up of the cell bodies of ganglion cells, this layer sends axons outward to eventually form the optic nerve.

- **Inner Plexiform Layer**:  
   This is where the axons of bipolar cells connect with ganglion cells. Amacrine cell dendrites also interact here, modulating electrical signals and preventing lateral signal enhancement.

- **Inner Nuclear Layer**:  
   This layer contains the cell bodies of bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cells. Bipolar cells act as conduits, transmitting synaptic signals from photoreceptors to ganglion cells, while horizontal cells regulate feedback to rods and cones.

- **Outer Plexiform Layer**:  
   The zone where photoreceptor cell projections synapse with the dendrites of cells located in the inner nuclear layer.

- **Outer Nuclear Layer**:  
   This layer houses the cell bodies of rods and cones.

- **External Limiting Membrane**:  
   A structure formed by gap junctions between photoreceptor cells and Müller cells, it separates the cell bodies of rods and cones from their inner and outer segments.

- **Photoreceptor Layer**:  
   Composed of the inner and outer segments of rods and cones. The outer segments contain membrane-bound discs with light-sensitive pigments, like rhodopsin, crucial for phototransduction, while the inner segments house mitochondria to support the photoreceptors' high energy demands.

- **Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE)**:  
   The outermost retinal layer, one cell thick, lies between the neural retina and the Bruch membrane, adjacent to the vascular choroid. The RPE forms part of the blood-retinal barrier and plays key roles, including ion and water transport, secretion of growth factors, and recycling of retinal molecules for phototransduction. Its cells intermix with the outer segments of rods and cones, ensuring their maintenance and supporting the underlying capillary endothelium.

### Macula

The macula, also referred to as the macula lutea due to its yellowish pigment, represents the most sensitive region of the retina, providing the highest level of visual sharpness. It is situated temporally relative to the optic disc, as observed during a fundoscopic exam. The macular pigments, lutein and zeaxanthin, are carotenoids responsible for the yellow hue. These pigments possess anti-inflammatory properties and filter blue light.

Dietary intake of lutein and zeaxanthin has been demonstrated to enhance pigment density and is linked to a lower risk of diabetic retinopathy in adults and retinopathy of prematurity in pre-term infants. At the center of the macula lies the **fovea**, a depression devoid of blood vessels that is densely packed with cones.

The macula is further divided into progressively smaller concentric zones, each exhibiting a reduction in rod density and fewer cell layers overlying the photoreceptor cells:

- **Perifovea**
- **Parafovea**
- **Fovea**
- **Foveal Avascular Zone**
- **Foveola**
- **Umbo**

## Embryology

The retina develops from the diencephalon of the embryo, beginning as the optic
vesicle during the first month of gestation and forming an invagination known as the
optic sulcus. This invagination leads to the creation of the retina's neural and
pigmented layers. Surrounding the optic vesicle during this stage, mesenchymal tissue
later differentiates into the uvea.

The neural retina originates from the inner layer of the optic vesicle, while the
pigmented retina arises from the outer layer. Axons from ganglion cells extend
through the optic stalk, which connects the optic cup to the embryo, and these axons
eventually form the optic nerve. On the ventral side, a secondary invagination, the
optic fissure, encloses a temporary blood vessel called the hyaloid artery, which later
develops into the central retinal artery.
