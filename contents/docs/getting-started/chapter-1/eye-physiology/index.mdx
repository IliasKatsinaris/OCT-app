## Introduction

The proper operation of the eye depends on its ability to absorb and process light energy from the environment, generate action potentials in specific nerve cells, and transmit those potentials via optic nerve (cranial nerve II) to the brain. Light is transmitted and focused onto the retina, the sensory component of the eye, by the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens. Components such as the choroid, aqueous and vitreous humor, and the lacrimal system are crucial for physiological balance, intraocular pressure preservation, and nourishment of ocular tissues.

## Issues of Concern

Visual sharpness relies on accurate refraction or bending of light flowing through structures of varying densities as the light travels through the cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous humor before hitting the retina. In order to focus on objects that are near or far, the ciliary muscle contracts and relaxes, changing the shape of the lens, which is the adjustable component of the refractive system.

## Cellular Level

The retina is composed of two types of photoreceptor cells: cones and rods. Rods are the cells mainly responsible for scotopic vision, or low-light sight. The fovea, a small depression in the retina where visual acuity is the strongest, lies about 15 to 20 degrees from the rods, the more prevalent cell type of the retina. There are about 90 million rod cells in the retina. The cones provide color vision, high spatial sharpness and are the cell-type most activated at higher light levels when photopic vision is dominant. The fovea has the highest density of cones and is rod free. The retina contains roughly 6 million cone cells. It should also be mentioned that the location of the optic nerve where photoreceptor cells are not present, has a "blind spot" in the visual field.

Cones have a quicker reaction with short integration periods, are directionally selective, and have great acuity, whereas rods have more photopigment, strong amplification, highly convergent retinal pathways, and high sensitivity. The term "bleaching" describes the absorption of a photon by a pigment molecule. Cones are grouped in a chromatic arrangement of three distinct pigments, whereas rods are achromatic, meaning they contain just one type of pigment. In the fovea, this arrangement appears as what is known as the "cone

## Mechanism

The photopigment in rods is named rhodopsin. The gene for human rhodopsin, a G-protein-coupled receptor with seven transmembrane domains and 348 amino acids, is found on chromosome 3. Rhodopsin contains a protein called scotopsin and its covalently linked cofactor, retinal. The chromophore retinal is located in a pocket formed by the transmembrane domains of scotopsin. Retinal is a vitamin A derivative converted from dietary beta-carotene.

In contrast to rods, there are three types of cones: S-cones (sensitive to short wavelength), M-cones (sensitive to medium wavelength), and L-cones (sensitive to long wavelength). The X chromosome encodes the M-cone and L-cone photopigment genes, whereas chromosome 7 encodes the S-cone photopigment gene. All cone receptors include the protein photopsin in altered forms to allow activation by various wavelengths of light. The different types of photopsin, which are also opsins combined with retinal, are the cone equivalent of rhodopsin in rods. Photopsin I, II, and III have absorption maxima for yellowish-green, green and bluish-violet light respectively. The higher visual sharpness linked with cones is because of their individual connections to the optic nerve, which enables better distinction between isolated signals. Cones are less effective than rods at each stage of the light response production process, and the reactions that terminate such a light response are quicker. Melanopsin is located in the ganglion cells of the retina and is in charge of non-visual reactions to light including the regulation of circadian rhythms and the pupillary reflex. Like invertebrate opsins, melanopsins work by absorbing light and starting a chain reaction that enables the brain to create and alter the body's circadian rhythm. The absorption of blue light by melanopsin can interfere with the body's circadian rhythm and sometimes leads to insomnia.

Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the innermost layer of the retina receive signals from photoreceptor cells via bipolar cells. These cells then send the signals to the brain via the optic nerve, which is made up of bundled RGC axons. Retinal horizontal cells are in charge of providing regulatory feedback to photoreceptor cells. Interestingly, exposure to light inhibits the release of photoreceptor neurotransmitters; photon absorption inhibits the release of glutamate, which is released in dark conditions and causes the membrane to be depolarized at rest.

## Clinical Significance

Astigmatism refers to a fading of vision due to the inconsistent curvature of the cornea or the lens. Refractive surgery or the use of extraocular lenses, such as glasses or contact lenses, are typically used to compensate for such anomalies. Myopia or nearsightedness is the result of an abnormally long eyeball or thick lens. Hyperopia or farsightedness is usually due to an abnormally short globe or thin lens. Refractive surgery and/or intra- or extraocular lenses are used to treat both kinds of vision impairments.

Glaucoma refers to a group of conditions that cause optic nerve damage due to high intraocular pressure. The most prevalent kind of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, which is distinguished by a normal iridocorneal angle—the angle formed by the iris and cornea. Other types of glaucoma contain closed-angle and normal-tension glaucoma. The origin of primary glaucoma is still mostly unclear, although some cases of glaucoma are caused by gene mutations. Glaucoma is usually associated with either an excess of aqueous humor or defect in the drainage of aqueous.

Achromatopsia describes a partial or total color vision absence. In most cases, it is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Contrary to achromatopsia, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affects the rod cells of the retina. As the condition progresses, rods gradually disappear, resulting in reduced peripheral vision, sometimes referred to as tunnel vision, and trouble seeing at night. Often, symptoms start in childhood and get worse as people age.

The most common retinal diseases include age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. AMD exists in two forms: dry (atrophic) and wet (exudative or neovascular). In most people, AMD starts as the dry form and in some of them, it progresses to the wet type (15-20%). AMD is always bilateral, but not necessarily the same form in both eyes. Furthermore, the disease does not necessarily advance at the same rate in both eyes. Degeneration of the retinal structure is a common feature of both AMD and DR and it disrupts the phototransduction pathway. In diabetic retinopathy, both blood vessels and neurons are damaged by the excess of glucose, and in severe cases, the proliferation of new blood vessels can further aggravate visual impairments. Damaged cellular components such drusen (extracellular) and lipofuscin (intracellular) accumulate in AMD. This leads to damage to the macula which result in dysfunctional central vision and can end up in complete blindness. Choroidal neovascularization can also aggravate AMD. The onset and progression of AMD have been linked to numerous genes.
