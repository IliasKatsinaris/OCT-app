It is necessary for ophthalmologists to diagnose various eye diseases as early as possible. Over the years many diagnostic techniques and treatments have been developed. One of the most modern diagnostic technologies is Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), which has many advantages (eg. safe, non-ionizing, non-invasive) and only a few disadvantages. For the reasons above it is a very useful tool for the modern ophthalmologist.

In this work, we will firstly present the anatomy and physiology of the eye, as well as the OCT technology, the physical principles of its operation and also in which medical conditions and diseases it can provide valuable information to the ophthalmologist.

Subsequently, an educational application is developed which will educate the ophthalmology resident in the field of Optical Coherence Tomography, as well as give him the ability to self-assess through multiple choice questions.
