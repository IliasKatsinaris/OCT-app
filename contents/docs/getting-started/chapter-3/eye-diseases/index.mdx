## OCT in Ophthalmology

Due to the low scattering in the tissues of the eye, OCT immediately found
application in ophthalmology where it has the most applications. Thus characteristics
such as changes in the thickness of the retina, corneal tissue and optic nerve are
measured, detecting changes in the early stages of eye diseases such as glaucoma. In
fact, as it has the ability to distinguish between three corneal tissues, OCT is used as
an aid in operations such as PRK and LASIK (refractive surgeries). In general,
geometric measurements are made with great precision, which is very useful in
ophthalmology. Below we will see OCT images from the eye and what they
correspond to. Superficial lesions, intraretinal lesions, deep lesions, and lesions
resulting in low reflectance appear as black, optically blank marks on the OCT image.
OCT can show changes in the back of the eye such as detecting fluid within the retinal
layers or below the retina, macular holes, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular
degeneration, as well as evaluating and analyzing structures of the anterior segment
such as anterior chamber area, iris volume and thickness. OCT should never be
considered as the sole criterion for the diagnosis or treatment of any ophthalmological
disease. Certain tissues of the eye exhibit high reflectivity under normal conditions.
These are the retinal nerve fibre layer, the internal limiting membrane, and the retinal
pigment epithelium. High reflectivity is also a feature of reduced retinal thickness,
which occurs in retinal atrophy, and scar tissue. Lesions showing high reflectivity can
be superficial, intraretinal, or in the deep retina.

and diffuse retinal hemorrhages are seen. The right OCT photograph shows cystic spaces
in the retina (white arrows) suggestive of retinal edema. Lower arrows indicate serous
retinal detachment._

Generally the applications of OCT in the eye are divided into intraretinal and
subretinal. Intraretinal includes retinal edema, cystoid edema, cysts, micro-cysts, and
macular holes. OCT offers sequential scans that are useful in quantifying intraretinal
and subretinal fluids. In subretinal applications is retinal detachment where serous
fluid causes elevation of the retinal layers. The image looks like a transparent bubble.
OCT shows an optically empty space with or without cells or exudate. In glaucoma
nerve losses lead to characteristic structural changes in the optic nerve head and
retinal nerve fibre capillary layer. The recognition of topographical changes by the
physician is therefore important for the diagnosis of glaucoma and the monitoring of
its progression. These topographical changes are observed with the OCT method. In
an OCT image of a retina, the red points represent layers of nerve fibres, the retinal
pigment epithelium and the capillaries of the choroid which have the highest
reflectivity. Black or blue areas show little reflectivity. These are photoreceptor layer,
the choroid and vitreous fluid or blood. The applications in ophthalmology are
numerous and it is really important to mention that the operator of the machine plays
a big role in the final OCT images.

## Clinical Significance

Optical Coherence Tomography is particularly effective for diagnosing and managing
various eye pathologies. Below are conditions where OCT is most beneficial:

### Retinal Diseases

**Diabetic Retinopathy**: Detects macular edema, retinal thickening, and
microaneurysms.

**Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)**: Shows macular edema and other structural changes.
Central Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC): Highlights serous retinal detachment and
subretinal fluid.

### Macular Diseases

**Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD)**: OCT helps detect drusen, retinal
pigment epithelial detachment, and choroidal neovascularization.
**
Macular Edema**: Common in diabetic retinopathy or vein occlusions, OCT
visualizes fluid accumulation in the retina.

**Epiretinal Membrane (ERM)**: OCT reveals the presence and thickness of a
membrane on the retinal surface.

**Macular Hole**: OCT identifies and stages the macular hole, guiding treatment
decisions

### Glaucoma

**Optic Nerve Head Analysis**: OCT assesses the optic nerve head for cupping and
nerve fiber layer thinning.

**Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer (RNFL) Thickness**: Measures RNFL loss, a key
indicator of glaucoma progression.

**Ganglion Cell Layer Analysis**: Identifies early glaucomatous damage.

### Inherited Retinal Disorders

**Retinitis Pigmentosa**: OCT can show photoreceptor layer thinning or cystoid
macular edema.

**Stargardt Disease**: Highlights changes in the retinal pigment epithelium and
photoreceptor loss.

### Anterior Segment Diseases

**Angle-Closure Glaucoma**: OCT visualizes the iridocorneal angle.

**Corneal Diseases**: Maps corneal thickness and detects keratoconus.

### Optic Nerve Diseases

**Optic Neuritis**: Assesses RNFL thinning, indicative of optic nerve damage.

**Papilledema**: Visualizes optic disc swelling due to raised intracranial pressure.

### Vitreoretinal Interface Disorders

**Vitreomacular Traction (VMT)**: Identifies tractional forces between the vitreous and
retina.

**Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)**: Confirms the presence and extent of
vitreous detachment.

### Other Conditions

**Uveitis**: Identifies cystoid macular edema and other retinal changes.

**Myopic Degeneration**: Detects structural abnormalities like staphylomas or choroidal
thinning.

## Surgical Considerations

**Round hole retinal detachment** is often treated surgically through laser demarcation,
which helps promote adhesion between the neural retinal layers and the retinal
pigment epithelium.** Laser photocoagulation** is typically used for smaller
detachments, as it helps limit the spread of subretinal fluid by acting as a barrier to its
progression.

For conditions involving vitreous clouding, such as** steroid hyalosis** or **vitreoretinal
traction** (where the vitreous body pulls on the retina), a vitrectomy is a common
procedure. This involves the removal of the vitreous, typically performed through the
pars plana of the sclera.
